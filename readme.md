For this project, I chose to do a resume for fictional character Hermione Granger. I chose custom icons and cropped a photo of her two different ways to fit. I created views for mobile, iPad and desktop views. For mobile, all of the squares are 100%, for iPad, they are spread to 50% width and responsive they have 33% width. 

I also resized boxes and icons to display better for the different sizes.
